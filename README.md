# pytensor-special
This package implements scipy's special functions in pytensor. Only functions that do not have implementation in pytensor will be implemented here. However, for convenience, already implemented functions will be automatically imported as well.

This package is written based on my need and use case. As such, some functions will be slower to implement than others. If you need a function that is not implemented here, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
